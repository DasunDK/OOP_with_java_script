    <h1>OOP Lesson-06</h1>

    <h3>5. Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Shape' with a method to calculate the area. Create
        two subclasses, 'Circle' and 'Triangle', that inherit from the 'Shape' class and override the area calculation
        method. Create an instance of the 'Circle' class and calculate its area. Similarly, do the same for the
        'Triangle' class. </h3>
